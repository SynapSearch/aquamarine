# Aquamarine

Transparency, simplicity, and creativity are necessary for recruiting because we believe you are more than just a piece of paper.

We are trying to solve the redundancy and tediousness of the current recruiting system. Students have no way to stand out leaving many skills unseen by a recruiter. Additionally, many recruitment websites use broken methods of recruiting that do not allow for some qualities certain candidates may wish to showcase. By creating an interactive application platform acting to match recruiters with the most qualified applicants. Students will be allowed to showcase soft skills and experiences through a short video or portfolio in additional to the traditional resume format.



Aquamarine contains the codebase for all things regarding the website platform.
